//components : componenets re independent and reuable bits of code. they serve the same purpose as javascript functions, but woek in isolation and retuen HTML
/*--> in react everything is based on functional component or class based component
 */
//syntax of functional component:

// function Compone() {
//   // !st letter is always a captial and this should return the jsx
//   return <div>Component</div>;
// }
// export default Compone;

/*-->  JSX(js xml): jsx allows us to wtite HTML in react JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in react
-> the html code which is present in the js will be compiled into the js code, it can to seen thorugh babel.com website
*/

// function App() {
//   return (
//     <section>
//       <p>
//         when we are returning more than one tag then it should be weapped in a
//         single tag like section or div
//       </p>
//       <article>hello</article>
//     </section>
//   );
// }

//-->Expressions in JSX: expressions inside curly braces. it can a react varaible, or propertu, or any other valid javascript expression JSX will excute the expression and return the result.
// const myName = "manoj";
// const multi = (a, b) => {
//   a * b;
// };
// const specialClass = "simple-class";
// function Component() {
//   return (
//     <>
//       {/*rendering varible vlues*/}
//       <h1>{myName}</h1>

//       <p>2+2={2 + 2}</p>
 
//       <p>my friends list:{["Alex", "joh", "jardan"]}</p>

//       <p>2*2{multi(2, 2)}</p>

//       <p className={specialClass}>this is the special class</p>
//     </>
//   );
// }

//--> Lists: in react, we will render lists with some type of loop. the javascirpt map() array method is generally the preferred method.

//props/ properties": props are arguments passed into react components, props are passed to componenets via HTML attributes.

//conditional rendering: conditional rendering in react works the same way conditions work in javascript. use javascript, 
//                       use js operaters like if to create elements represting the current state and let react update the ui to the match them.

// to use CSS in the jsx we have to use {{}}

// to install bootstrap in react:
/*  npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
place this import statement in the index.js file which is the main file present in the src folder
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
*/

/* State :- the state is a built-in react object that is used to contain data or information about the component .
           A componeents state can change over time , whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

hooks : hooks are new addition in react 16.8 , they let you use state and other react features withour writing a class.

useState() hook: the react useState hook allows us to tract state in a function component.State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in a application.
 */

/* handling Forms in React js :- in general form having a function in js it will handling them,
                      But in REACT JS,one mutable state is kept in state of a component and only updated with using a usestate hooks.

useEffect() : the useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
           ex: fetching data, directly updating the DOm
*/

/* Prop drilling : if a data from component a is passed to component c, if there is a component b is in between then, the data is passed through the component b , w
                    which is not a good practice.
-->to solve that solution is to use Context API , and the optimal approach is useContext();

Context API : import (createContext)
              creating a instance of (createContext)
              wrap that data into provider compoenet
              consumer methos will allow to consume data which is provided by the provider

Context Hook : useContext()
 react context is a way to manage state globally it can be used to together with te suestate hook to chare state between deeplu nested components more easily than with usestate alone.
*/

/* useReducer() : usereducer is a hook in react that is similar to usestate,but it is desinged for more complx state objects or state transitions
                    that involve multiple sub-values. ita llows you to manage stte in a functional, immutable way.
    state: 
    dispatch: [value,setValue] dispatch is kind of setvalue form useState
    reducer: custome state logic ,    
    intitalState={}         

    useRef() :- use ref os a hook in react that allows you to access the properties of a DOM element. it is uesd when you need to access,
                the value of an element, or the current dimensions of an element.
